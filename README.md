# jQuery TourBus

A tour/walkthrough plugin for developers. It includes limited automatic behavior,
more like a 'toolkit' than some of the others out there.

## Installation

CoffeeScript and LESS source files are available in `src` while
compiled/pre-processed/minified files are in `dist`. Wire up your
asset packager appropriately or include the css and js by hand
old-school:

    <script src='path/to/jquery.min.js'></script>
    <script src='path/to/jquery-tourbus.min.js'></script>
    <link href='path/to/jquery-tourbus.min.css' media='all' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' />

jQuery is the only dependency. I think technically it will be able to
support Zepto without too much difficulty.

## Documentation

Docs coming to this readme at some point, but for now you'll find all
the details and a demo on [the website](http://ryanfunduk.com/jquery-tourbus).
